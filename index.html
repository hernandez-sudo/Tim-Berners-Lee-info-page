<p>
        In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web
        , an Internet-based hypermedia initiative for global
        information sharing. He wrote the first web client and
        server in 1990. His specifications of URIs, HTTP and 
        HTML were refined as web technology spread. 
        He is Director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), 
        to lead the Web to its full potential. In 2001 
        Berners-Lee became a Fellow of the Royal Society. 
        He has been the recipient of several international awards. 
        In 2004 he was knighted by H.M. Queen Elizabeth, and in 
        2007 he was awarded the Order of Merit. At MIT, Berners-Lee 
        is the 3Com Founders Professor of Engineering in the School
         of Engineering, with a joint appointment in the Department 
         of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the 
         Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
          (CSAIL). He is also a Professor in the Electronics and 
          Computer Science Department at the University of 
          Southampton, UK.
